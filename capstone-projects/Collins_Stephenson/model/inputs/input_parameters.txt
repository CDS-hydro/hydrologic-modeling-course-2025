# List of model inputs
Domain: 222 m x 1 m x 6.1 m
	- assume that local vertical datum is zero for z direction (z values in relation to local vertical datum)
Starting resolution: 2 m x 1 m x 0.05 m
Assuming homogenous and isotropic material 
	- permeability k = 10e-6 $cm^2$ (assumption made based on permeability ranges for clean sands and gravel (Figure 32 - Woessner and Poeter, 2020)
	- porosity n = 0.30 (assumption made based on recommended values for coarse sand and gravels (Table 2 - Woessner and Poeter, 2020)
Boundaries
	- bottom of domain will be an impermeable boundary (clay layer at ~20 ft (~6.1 m) below ground surface)
	- canal side of domain will be a seepage boundary (have canal stage data that I will input as a text file to the transient model)
	- river side of domain will be a seepage face boundary (have river stage data that I will input as a text file to the transient model)
Initial conditions 
	- water table at -3 m  below local vertical datum (based on current field observations)
Time
	- steady state - long time (enough for model to stablize)
	-1 year simulation time


Planning to use Brooks-Corey model for saturation constitutive equation (better for coarse textured soils)
